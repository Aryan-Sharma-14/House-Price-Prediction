# 🏡 House Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts house prices using **Random Forest Regressor** based on features like size, location, and amenities.  
This project demonstrates **EDA, data visualization, and model building** with Python.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Built a **Random Forest** model to predict house prices.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends.
- Created **visualizations** for better insights.
- Demonstrated model evaluation using **MAE** and **R² Score**.
